## Documentation Maintenance Rule

**CRITICAL: Always update documentation when making changes to:**

1. **Database Schema Changes:**
   - When adding/modifying tables, columns, indexes, or constraints
   - When changing RLS policies or triggers
   - When creating new migrations
   - **Update:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → Database Schema section

2. **Application Flow Changes:**
   - When modifying data flow between components
   - When adding/removing context providers
   - When changing API routes or request/response formats
   - When modifying component interactions
   - **Update:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → Data Flow and Key Components sections

3. **New Features:**
   - When adding new features or major functionality
   - When changing user workflows
   - **Update:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → Features section

4. **Component Changes:**
   - When adding new major components
   - When significantly refactoring existing components
   - **Update:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → Key Components section

## Documentation File Location

- **Main Documentation:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Database Schema:** Documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → Database Schema section
- **Migrations:** Located in `supabase/migrations/`

## Before Committing Changes

Before committing any changes that affect:
- Database schema
- Application architecture
- Data flow
- Major features

**Verify:**
- [ ] Documentation in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is updated
- [ ] ER diagram (if schema changed) is accurate
- [ ] Data flow diagrams reflect current behavior
- [ ] Component descriptions are current
- [ ] API route documentation is accurate

## Quick Reference

When making changes, ask yourself:
- "Does this change how data flows through the app?" → Update Data Flow section
- "Does this change the database structure?" → Update Database Schema section
- "Does this add/change a major feature?" → Update Features section
- "Does this add/change a component?" → Update Key Components section
